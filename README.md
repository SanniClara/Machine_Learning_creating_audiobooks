# Machine_Learning_creating_audiobooks
this repository contains code parts and a README instruction on how to start with creating your own audio files. It is based on several different tutorials and Plattform descriptions merged together. 
## Starting
In the following i will shortly list up erery step you need to do to creat an audio file using the Google text-to-speech API 

1. collect PDF-books you like 
2. create an Google account and sign up at at the Google Cloud Machine Learning platform (they will ask for your Credit Card).
I was able to avoid this by using a university lience
3. Create a new project on the platform 
4. Download your JSON verification 
5. 


## Downloads 

Start with installing all the node modules you need for the text to speech in your local file where you will have your Javascript Code

Download 

## Installation
```
npm install file-system --save
npm install pdf-to-text
npm install util
npm install node-fetch --save
npm install FileReader
```
## Contributing 
Any pull requests are very welcome. There is one problem that i'm hoping to solve with the community. The problem ist that i still can't pass on .txt files to the Google API. It either has to do with async function or the content of the txt file. I'm open for help. :) 

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
