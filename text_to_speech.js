Four women, actressesâ€”two of them of European descent, which is to say, under white light people with color-normal vision identify their skin as being on the lighter side of the distribution, with more pinks and cream tones. And two of them were of African descent, so under white light most people identify their skin as being darker, with more browns and deeper reddish shades. Are the distributions wide? Yes. Is this racially fraught? Probably. But stick with me, because then the researchers switched from white light to low-pressure sodium.';
